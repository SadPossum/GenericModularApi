# Persistence and Tenancy

Persistence is module-owned. The shared infrastructure provides abstractions and provider selection, but modules own their DbContexts, schemas, migrations, repositories, and outbox tables.

## Providers

Supported providers:

- SQL Server
- PostgreSQL

Default provider:

```json
{
  "Persistence": {
    "Provider": "SqlServer"
  }
}
```

Connection keys:

- `ConnectionStrings:SqlServer`
- `ConnectionStrings:PostgreSql`

Persistence configuration is validated at startup by modules that register persistence. `Persistence:Provider` must be `SqlServer` or `PostgreSql`, and the matching provider connection string must be present. Shared infrastructure alone does not require database configuration.

## Module-Owned Migrations

Each module with persistence should have provider-specific migration projects:

```text
<Module>.Persistence.SqlServerMigrations/
<Module>.Persistence.PostgreSqlMigrations/
```

Auth uses:

```text
auth.__ef_migrations_history
```

as its schema-local migration history table.

## Adding Migrations

```powershell
.\eng\add-migration.ps1 -Module Auth -Provider SqlServer -Name AddExample
.\eng\add-migration.ps1 -Module Auth -Provider PostgreSql -Name AddExample
```

`eng/add-migration.ps1` works for any module with `<Module>.Persistence`, `<Module>.Persistence.SqlServerMigrations`, and `<Module>.Persistence.PostgreSqlMigrations` projects. It discovers the DbContext from the persistence project; pass `-Context <Name>DbContext` when discovery is ambiguous.

Create migrations for both providers when a schema change is provider-agnostic.

Check model-to-migration drift before finishing persistence work:

```powershell
.\eng\check-migrations.ps1 -NoBuild
```

The script discovers every provider migration project under `src/Modules` and runs EF's pending-model-change check against the matching design-time factory. `eng/verify.ps1` includes this check by default after build; pass `-SkipMigrationCheck` only for a deliberately narrow local loop.

Design-time factories live in provider-specific migration projects, not runtime persistence projects:

- SQL Server factory: `<Module>.Persistence.SqlServerMigrations`
- PostgreSQL factory: `<Module>.Persistence.PostgreSqlMigrations`

The pinned local `dotnet-ef` tool in `.config/dotnet-tools.json` uses the same version as `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`; update both together when EF Core is upgraded.

`eng/add-migration.ps1` uses the selected migration project as both the EF target project and startup project. Factories should use `DesignTimeDbContextOptionsFactory.CreateSqlServerOptions(...)` or `CreatePostgreSqlOptions(...)` from `Shared.Infrastructure.Persistence` so default local connection strings and migration history configuration stay consistent.

`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` belongs only in provider migration projects.

## Applying Migrations

Do not auto-apply migrations from `Host.Api` startup.

Use explicit migration steps in tests, local development, or deployment automation. Integration tests use `MigrateAsync`, not `EnsureCreated`.

## Indexing Tenant-Scoped Reads

Tenant-scoped tables should index the tenant id together with the next selective read-path column. Examples:

- unique tenant-local identifiers, such as `(TenantId, Sku)`;
- tenant-local list ordering, such as `(TenantId, RegisteredAtUtc)`;
- tenant-scoped authorization lookups, such as `(PrincipalId, TenantId)` when global and tenant assignments are checked together.

Do not add cross-module foreign keys to optimize reads. Use local projections, duplicated identifiers, or module-owned indexes instead.

## Unit of Work

EF Core `DbContext` is the practical unit of work. A module unit of work wraps:

- domain event collection;
- domain event dispatch;
- outbox writes;
- EF Core commit;
- domain event clearing after successful commit.

## Tenancy Strategy

V1 tenancy uses a shared database:

- tenant-scoped entities include `TenantId`;
- tenant-scoped endpoints require `X-Tenant-Id` when tenancy is enabled;
- tenant-aware EF filters isolate reads and writes;
- local development can use the `default` tenant.

Tenancy configuration is validated at startup. `Tenancy:HeaderName` must be a valid HTTP header name and `Tenancy:LocalDefaultTenantId` must be non-empty, no longer than 128 characters, and free of whitespace or control characters, because the default/null tenant context also uses it when the optional Tenancy module is omitted.

`ITenantContextAccessor` is mutable runtime state, not authoritative domain data. Host/front-door/runtime boundaries set it from the request, CLI operation, or integration-event envelope and clear it before applying a new tenant so reused scopes cannot inherit a stale tenant id. Domain entities and integration events still store their own normalized tenant ids.

## No Cross-Module Foreign Keys

Modules must not create foreign keys to another module's tables.

Use one of these instead:

- duplicate stable identifiers;
- consume another module's contract;
- publish/consume integration events;
- use an application-level consistency check.

## Tenant Safety Checklist

For tenant-scoped behavior:

- endpoint calls `.RequireTenant()`;
- command includes tenant context implicitly or explicitly;
- aggregate stores `TenantId`;
- repository queries preserve tenant filters;
- tests prove tenant isolation.
