# Shared Access Subject Foundation

## Decision

Keep `Shared.AccessControl` as a tiny backend-agnostic subject package, not as a generic authorization framework.

The package owns only the common vocabulary needed to pass the current actor across module boundaries:

```csharp
public enum AccessSubjectKind
{
    Unknown = 0,
    User = 1,
    AdminActor = 2,
    Service = 3,
    System = 4
}

public sealed record AccessSubject(
    AccessSubjectKind Kind,
    string Id,
    string? TenantId);
```

It normalizes subject ids and tenant ids, rejects unknown subject kinds, and stays free of HTTP, EF, Auth, Administration, Tenancy runtime, NATS, Redis, and external policy engines.

## Why

The first access-policy slice proved that `AccessSubject` is useful: API endpoints, CLI/admin flows, workers, and tests can pass a stable actor object without leaking `ClaimsPrincipal`, auth schemes, or raw claim parsing into application handlers.

The generic policy/evaluator layer did not earn its keep. In current modules it only wrapped simple tenant/user comparisons, while the important list/detail protection already comes from module-owned typed scopes that persistence must consume. The framework should stay small until repeated real modules prove a stronger common shape.

## Current Pattern

For product/resource reads:

```text
front door
  -> build AccessSubject and module-specific input
  -> application adapts input to module domain objects
  -> domain visibility policy returns a typed scope
  -> repository requires that scope
  -> persistence translates scope into SQL/read-model filters
```

For simple application-only checks that do not shape persistence, use direct code in the owning module. Do not introduce generic requirements or policy registrations until there is repeated real reuse.

## Module Ownership

The module that owns the resource owns the access language.

Good examples:

- Catalog owns region availability and returns `AvailableCatalogItemsScope`.
- Ordering owns current-user order visibility and returns `UserOrdersScope`.
- Notifications stores already-addressed notifications and performs simple current-user checks directly in application code.

Shared code must not know product concepts such as friend, blocked user, manager, HR, viewer, editor, catalog region, notification recipient, or order owner.

## Tenant Handling

`AccessSubject.TenantId` should be set when the caller acts inside a tenant.

Tenant isolation remains separate from resource visibility:

- tenant filters prevent cross-tenant data leaks;
- module visibility scopes decide which resources are visible inside an allowed tenant or across explicitly global/platform resources.

## Future Options

Add a persisted `AccessControl` module only when several modules need the same object-sharing model.

Possible future model:

```text
subject kind/id/tenant
resource module/type/id/tenant
relation or level
created by/at
expires at
source
```

External engines such as OPA, Cedar, OpenFGA, or SpiceDB remain optional adapters for concrete deployment needs. They should live outside the core subject package.

## Guardrails

- Do not add automatic endpoint filters that make authorization invisible.
- Do not add a generic EF query-filter builder for all modules.
- Do not cache allow/deny decisions unless the owning module documents revocation and invalidation.
- Do not put tenant ids, user ids, resource ids, subject ids, or policy input values in metric tags.
- Use not-found-shaped failures for private single-resource access when a forbidden response would reveal existence.
- Keep list/search/feed/export/stream reads scope-aware in repositories, projections, or read models.

## Tests

- `Shared.AccessControl` tests cover subject normalization and rejection.
- Module tests cover each domain visibility policy or direct application access check.
- Persistence tests prove typed scopes translate into query filters.
- Architecture tests keep the shared subject package backend-free and keep external access adapters out of domain projects.
