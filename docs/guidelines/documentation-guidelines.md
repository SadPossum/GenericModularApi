# Documentation Guidelines

Docs are part of the architecture. If a module or boundary changes, update the docs in the same change.

## Format

Use plain Markdown.

The docs should work in:

- GitHub;
- Visual Studio;
- Rider;
- VS Code;
- Obsidian.

Do not require Obsidian plugins or `.obsidian` settings.

## Structure

```text
docs/
  README.md
  getting-started/
  architecture/
  modules/
  guidelines/
  templates/
  adr/
```

## What to Document

Document when a change affects:

- module public API;
- module behavior;
- persistence schema;
- configuration;
- deployment;
- integration events;
- tenant behavior;
- test strategy;
- developer workflow.

## Module Docs

Each module should have a page in `docs/modules/`.

Use [../templates/module.md](../templates/module.md).

Minimum sections:

- purpose;
- projects;
- public contracts;
- endpoints;
- domain model;
- persistence;
- integration events;
- tests;
- extension points.

## ADRs

Use ADRs for decisions that are hard to reverse or likely to be questioned later.

Examples:

- adopting a tenancy strategy;
- introducing a new infrastructure adapter;
- changing module boundaries;
- replacing Auth implementation;
- changing event subject format.

Use [../templates/adr.md](../templates/adr.md).

## Writing Style

- Prefer present tense.
- Be specific about paths and commands.
- Keep claims tied to the current repo.
- Avoid marketing language.
- Avoid copying implementation details that will drift quickly unless the detail matters.
- Link to source files when useful.

## Docs Review Checklist

- Does the doc match current code?
- Are commands runnable from repo root?
- Are config keys spelled exactly?
- Are module boundaries clear?
- Is the page linked from `docs/README.md`?
- Is a template needed for repeating this doc shape?
