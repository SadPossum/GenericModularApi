# CQRS and Domain Events

The repo uses lightweight CQRS primitives instead of MediatR or another external dispatcher.

## Primitives

- `ICommand<TResponse>`
- `ITransactionalCommand<TResponse>`
- `IQuery<TResponse>`
- `ICommandHandler<TCommand, TResponse>`
- `IQueryHandler<TQuery, TResponse>`
- `IRequestDispatcher`
- `ICommandPipelineBehavior<TCommand, TResponse>`
- `IQueryPipelineBehavior<TQuery, TResponse>`
- `ICommandValidator<TCommand>`
- `IQueryValidator<TQuery>`

## Command Flow

```text
Endpoint
  -> command
  -> IRequestDispatcher
  -> validation behavior
  -> logging behavior
  -> unit-of-work behavior, for transactional commands
  -> command handler
  -> domain changes
  -> owning module unit of work commit
```

Commands that write persistent module state implement `ITransactionalCommand<TResponse>`.
The unit-of-work behavior derives the owning module from the command assembly name and commits exactly one matching `IUnitOfWork`.
Commands that do not write persistent state may stay as plain `ICommand<TResponse>` and skip the UoW behavior.

This is a small documented convention, not host composition scanning. Architecture tests guard module commands so state-writing commands stay explicit about transactionality.

## Query Flow

Queries use the same dispatcher shape, but they should not commit unit-of-work changes. Keep query handlers side-effect free.
The shared query pipeline validates, logs, and records metrics, but it does not cache or open transactions automatically.
Explicit cache-aside stays inside query handlers so each module controls keys, tags, and failure-result policy.
Architecture tests guard query handlers from depending on UoW, outbox, or invalidation contracts.

## Validation

Validation belongs in `ICommandValidator<TCommand>` and `IQueryValidator<TQuery>` implementations.

Validators should:

- check request shape and application preconditions;
- return expected validation failures;
- avoid database writes;
- avoid business behavior that belongs in aggregates.

## Domain Events

Aggregate roots collect domain events during behavior execution.
Concrete module domain events inherit `DomainEvent` for event id and occurrence time. Tenant-scoped domain events inherit `TenantDomainEvent`, which also normalizes tenant id through the shared tenant rules.
Payload-specific fields remain in the owning module domain project so events still speak the module's ubiquitous language.

The module unit of work:

1. Finds changed aggregate roots.
2. Collects domain events.
3. Dispatches domain event handlers before the EF Core commit.
4. Saves changes once.
5. Clears domain events only after successful commit.

This allows a domain event handler to write outbox records in the same database transaction as the aggregate change.
EF-backed modules with domain events should inherit `EfDomainEventUnitOfWork<TDbContext>` from `Shared.Infrastructure.Persistence` and pass their module schema/name constant into the base constructor. Module-specific unit-of-work classes should stay thin; the shared base owns the dispatch/save/clear ordering.

## Domain Event Handlers

Domain event handlers live in the owning module application layer.

Example:

```text
Auth.Domain.Events.MemberRegisteredDomainEvent
  -> Auth.Application.Handlers.MemberRegisteredOutboxProjector
  -> Auth.Persistence.AuthOutboxWriter
```

## Guidelines

- Commands mutate state.
- Persistent commands use `ITransactionalCommand<TResponse>`.
- Queries read state.
- Query handlers should not mutate persistent state or enqueue integration events.
- Aggregate methods enforce business invariants.
- Domain events describe something that already happened inside a module.
- Inherit domain events from `DomainEvent` or `TenantDomainEvent` instead of re-declaring common metadata in every event type.
- Integration events describe something published across module or process boundaries.
- Do not publish integration events directly from command handlers.
- Use domain event handlers to project committed domain facts into the outbox.
